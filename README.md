'Where I keep my projects I am creating to learn.'


THIS REPO CURRENTLY HAS::

1. Better Converter: A Basic unit converter, it converts km to miles, lbs to kg and minutes to seconds. using PySimpleGUI

2. Medical Patients: A project that I wrote up to try and give myself my own project to create. It is a Medical Patients filing system.
  I want this Medical patients filing system to record new patients, their names, age , gender, and allergies if any. 
    The patients need to be saved on Medical Patients.txt file so it can read and ignore any duplicate additions.
